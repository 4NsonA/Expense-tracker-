This project is a simple expense tracker built with HTML, CSS and  JavaScript. It allows users to add incomes and expenses, calculate the total balance, and display amounts dynamically.

This project was initially developed by following an online tutorial as part of a learning and revision process.
I adapted the project to work with euros (€) instead of dollars ($) and used it to reinforce my understanding of basic JavaScript concepts.

# Objectives

-> Practice JavaScript fundamentals (DOM manipulation, events, basic logic)

-> Understand how data flows between UI and logic

-> Reinforce good structuring habits in small front-end projects

# Technologies used
-> HTML
-> CSS
-> JavaScript

# Learning context

This project is part of a series of mini-projects made for learning purposes.
The core idea comes from an existing tutorial available online.
The goal was not originality, but hands-on practice and comprehension.


# Possible improvements

-> Add categories for expenses
-> Improve accessibility
-> Add charts
